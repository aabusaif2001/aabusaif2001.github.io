            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My passion for Web Development started when I began watching the show Silicon Valley about 3-4 years ago. The lessons learned from watching this show such as when Richards Hendricks was offered a large sum of money to buyout his company. But his willingness to work with Peter Gregory, (who didn't offer as much), in order to receive more of a 1-1 relationship which he saw more value in than just a buyout. I like to apply this to my life where I'm willing to work with anyone who has good values and work ethic, and I feel they are able to contribute to a cause instead of just seeing what's on the outside. </li>
                <li>Other interests I have outside of web development include the gym. The discipline it teaches me has always allowed me to apply that attribute in every aspect of my life.</li>
